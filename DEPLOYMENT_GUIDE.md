## **🌐 DEPLOYMENT OPTIONS**

### **Option 1: Netlify (Recommended)**
```bash
# 1. Connect your GitHub repo to Netlify
# 2. Set build command: npm run build
# 3. Set publish directory: dist
# 4. Add environment variables (see notes below)
# 5. Deploy!
```

#### Configure Environment Variables (Secrets stay local)
- Create a `.env.local` file (gitignored) following Next.js conventions. Example:
  ```bash
  NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=...
  NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=...
  NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=...
  NEXT_PUBLIC_GEMINI_API_KEY=...
  SUPABASE_URL=...
  SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=...
  GEMINI_API_KEY=...
  ```
- Keep `.env.local` out of Git; copy placeholders from `.env.example` if needed.
- To sync these values to Netlify without exposing them, run `./set-netlify-env.sh`. The script reads `.env.local` (or `.env`) and sets the corresponding Netlify environment variables, preferring `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` names when present.

### **Option 2: Vercel**
```bash
# 1. Connect GitHub repo to Vercel
# 2. Set framework preset: Vite
# 3. Add environment variables
# 4. Deploy!
```

### **Option 3: Manual Build & Upload**
```bash
npm install
npm run build
# Upload 'dist' folder to any static host
```
