# GitHub Actions Workflows Cleanup

## Overview
This document summarizes the cleanup of irrelevant GitHub Actions workflows from the repository.

## Problem Statement
The repository contained GitHub Actions workflows that were not relevant to the project's actual build system and runtime environment, potentially causing confusion and unnecessary CI/CD overhead.

## Project Architecture
- **Build Tool**: Vite (not Webpack)
- **Runtime**: Node.js >= 20.19.0
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript
- **Deployment**: Netlify
- **Backend Functions**: Supabase Edge Functions (use Deno runtime, deployed separately via Supabase CLI)

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed: `.github/workflows/webpack.yml`
**Reason**: Completely irrelevant to the project
- Project uses **Vite** as the build tool, not Webpack
- No `webpack.config.js` exists in the project
- The workflow tried to run `npx webpack` which would fail
- Build command in `package.json` is `vite build`, not webpack

**Original Workflow**:
- Ran on: ubuntu-latest
- Node versions: 18.x, 20.x, 22.x
- Commands: `npm install` + `npx webpack`

### 2. Removed: `.github/workflows/deno.yml`
**Reason**: Incorrectly configured for the project structure
- Deno is only used for Supabase Edge Functions (serverless functions in `/supabase/functions/`)
- These functions are deployed separately via Supabase CLI, not GitHub Actions
- The workflow tried to run `deno lint` and `deno test -A` on the project root
- The project root uses Node.js/npm, not Deno
- No Deno configuration files (`deno.json`) exist at the project root

**Original Workflow**:
- Ran on: ubuntu-latest
- Commands: `deno lint` + `deno test -A`
- Would fail because Deno tooling isn't set up for the main project

### 3. Updated: `.github/workflows/netlify-deploy.yml`
**Reason**: Fixed Node.js version to match project requirements
- Updated Node.js version from **18** to **20**
- Matches `package.json` requirement: `"node": ">=20.19.0"`
- Ensures consistent build environment

**Changes**:
```yaml
# Before
node-version: "18"

# After
node-version: "20"
```

## Remaining Workflow

### ✅ `.github/workflows/netlify-deploy.yml`
This workflow is **correct and relevant**:
- Uses Node.js 20 (matches project requirements)
- Installs dependencies with `npm install`
- Builds with `npm run build` (uses Vite)
- Deploys to Netlify
- Properly configured with environment variables for Supabase and Gemini API

**Workflow Details**:
- **Trigger**: Push to main branch, Pull requests to main
- **Runner**: ubuntu-latest
- **Node Version**: 20 (with npm cache)
- **Build Command**: `npm run build`
- **Deploy Target**: Netlify (publish-dir: ./dist)

## Verification

### Build Test
```bash
npm run build
# ✓ built in 7.93s
# All assets successfully generated in dist/
```

### File Changes Summary
- Deleted: `.github/workflows/deno.yml` (42 lines)
- Deleted: `.github/workflows/webpack.yml` (28 lines)
- Modified: `.github/workflows/netlify-deploy.yml` (1 line changed)
- **Total**: Removed 71 lines, added 1 line

## Benefits

1. **Clarity**: Repository now only contains relevant CI/CD workflows
2. **Efficiency**: No unnecessary workflow runs consuming GitHub Actions minutes
3. **Correctness**: The remaining workflow matches the actual project setup
4. **Maintainability**: Developers won't be confused by irrelevant workflows
5. **Reliability**: Node.js version now matches project requirements

## Future Considerations

If you need to add CI/CD for Supabase Edge Functions, you should:
1. Create a separate workflow specifically for Supabase functions
2. Use `supabase-cli` actions to deploy functions
3. Only trigger when files in `supabase/functions/` change
4. Configure Deno properly for the functions directory only
